go-utils
========

A collection of utilities that I use/find useful - currently I've only
pushed db/sql-util.

db/sqlutils
===========

This is a set of utilities to extra useful information about sql databases
that isn't exactly intuitive to retrieve (```show tables [in db]```,
```show databases``` and ```describe table [tableName]```).
